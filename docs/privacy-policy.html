    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 Data Stored Locally on Your Device (Offline-First)</h3>
    <p>The following data is stored <strong>only on your device</strong> and is never transmitted to our servers:</p>

        <li>Created meal recipes (My Meals) and saved ingredients</li>
        <li>AI Chat history and chat sessions</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Data Transmitted to Our Servers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device ID</strong> — A unique identifier generated for your device, used to manage Energy balance and prevent fraud. This is NOT linked to your personal identity.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy balance</strong> — Synced with Firebase Firestore for persistence across app reinstalls.</li>
        <li><strong>Food photos (temporarily)</strong> — When you use AI analysis, your food photo is sent to our backend server (Firebase Cloud Functions) for processing by Google Gemini AI. Photos are processed in real-time and are <strong>not stored</strong> on our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat messages (temporarily)</strong> — When using MiRO AI chat, your messages are sent to our backend for AI processing. Messages are processed in real-time and are <strong>not stored</strong> on our servers.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Firebase Services (Google)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloud Functions</strong> — Processes AI analysis requests and manages Energy deduction</li>
        <li><strong>Firestore</strong> — Stores Energy balance, subscription status, referral data, and gamification state</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> — Collects anonymous usage statistics (e.g., which features are used most, error rates). No personal data is included. You can opt out via your device's analytics settings.</li>
