    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>MiRO — My Intake Record Oracle</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 17, 2026<br>
    <strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 1, 2026</p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Your food data is stored locally on your device. Compact backups are synced securely via Firebase to protect your history across devices. No account required. No personal data collected.</strong>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 Data Stored Locally on Your Device (Offline-First)</h3>
    <p>The following data is stored <strong>only on your device</strong> and is never transmitted to our servers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Food entries (name, calories, nutrients, photos)</li>
        <li>Health goals (daily calorie goal, macro targets, water goal)</li>
        <li>Basic personal information (name, gender, age, weight, height, activity level)</li>
        <li>Cuisine preference (your typical cuisine selection)</li>
        <li>Created meal recipes (My Meals) and saved ingredients</li>
        <li>AI Chat history and chat sessions</li>
        <li>App settings and preferences</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Data Transmitted to Our Servers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device ID</strong> — A unique identifier generated for your device, used to manage Energy balance and prevent fraud. This is NOT linked to your personal identity.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy balance</strong> — Synced with Firebase Firestore for persistence across app reinstalls.</li>
        <li><strong>Compact food history</strong> — Food entry text data (food name, calories, nutrients, meal type, timestamp) and custom meals are automatically backed up to Firebase during daily Energy claims. This enables cross-device restoration.</li>
        <li><strong>Health profile</strong> — Gender, age, weight, height, activity level, calorie goal, macro targets, meal budgets, and cuisine preference are synced for seamless device transitions.</li>
        <li><strong>Thumbnail images</strong> — Small compressed images (~40-80 KB) of food photos with nutrition metadata are uploaded to Firebase Storage after AI analysis for cloud backup purposes. Full-resolution photos are <strong>never uploaded</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Food photos (temporarily)</strong> — When you use AI analysis, your food photo is sent to our backend server (Firebase Cloud Functions) for processing by Google Gemini AI. Photos are processed in real-time and are <strong>not stored</strong> on our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat messages (temporarily)</strong> — When using MiRO AI chat, your messages are sent to our backend for AI processing. Messages are processed in real-time and are <strong>not stored</strong> on our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Referral codes</strong> — If you use the referral system, your MiRO ID and referral interactions are stored in Firebase.</li>
        <li><strong>AR Scale data</strong> — Detected object labels, bounding box coordinates (px), image dimensions, and pixel-per-cm calibration ratio are synced as part of your food history backup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Data We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No email address</li>
        <li>No phone number</li>
        <li>No real name (unless you optionally set one in your profile)</li>
        <li>No location data</li>
        <li>No contacts or address book</li>
        <li>No advertising identifiers</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Firebase Services (Google)</h3>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Firestore</strong> — Stores Energy balance, subscription status, referral data, gamification state, compact food history backups, and Recovery Key hashes</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Storage</strong> — Stores small food thumbnail images (~40-80 KB) with nutrition metadata for cloud backup and restoration</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> — Collects anonymous usage statistics (e.g., which features are used most, error rates). No personal data is included. You can opt out via your device's analytics settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Google Gemini AI</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Food photos and text descriptions are processed by Google Gemini AI via our Firebase backend</li>
        <li>Data is processed in real-time and not stored by our backend</li>

        <li>We store: subscription status, start date, expiry date, and product ID</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Referral System</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your MiRO ID (a unique code) may be shared voluntarily with friends for referral rewards</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Fully anonymized — no device ID, personal identity, or location data is included</li>
        <li>Stripped of EXIF metadata and any identifying information</li>
        <li>Aggregated at population level — individual users cannot be identified</li>
