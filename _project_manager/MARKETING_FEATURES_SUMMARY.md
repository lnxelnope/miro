## 1. UNIQUE SELLING POINTS — Why MiRO Is the Most Accurate Food Tracker in the World

### 1.1 AI Food Analysis — Deeper Than Anyone Else
- Snap a photo of any meal → AI deconstructs every single ingredient with individual calorie counts
- Food Scientist-level accuracy — detects absorbed cooking oil, sugar hidden in sauces, invisible seasonings
- Supports sub-ingredients (e.g., Fried Chicken → Chicken Meat + Flour Batter + Absorbed Oil, each with separate calories)
- Works with any cuisine, any language

### 1.2 Smart Search Modes — Food vs. Product
- Before AI analysis, users can select the search mode:
  - **Food Mode** — For home-cooked or restaurant meals. AI estimates from visible ingredients and cooking methods
  - **Product Mode** — For packaged products with nutrition labels. AI reads brand, packaging text, and uses official nutrition data no need to scan barcode anymore.
- This pre-selection dramatically improves accuracy because the AI knows exactly what kind of analysis to perform
- **No other app gives users this control**

### 1.3 Fully Editable Ingredients — True Accuracy Is in Your Hands
- After AI analysis, users can **edit, remove, or add** individual ingredients
- **Real-world example:** You eat instant noodles but skip the seasoning packet → just delete the seasoning ingredient → calories recalculate automatically
- **Another example:** Restaurant gives you extra rice → adjust the rice amount → everything updates
- This makes MiRO the ONLY food tracker where **the user controls the final accuracy**, not just the AI
- The combination of AI analysis + user editing = the most accurate calorie count possible

### 1.4 Cuisine Preference — Our Secret Weapon
- Users select their "typical cuisine" from 15 options (Thai, Japanese, Korean, Indian, Mexican, etc.)
- AI biases its analysis based on the user's cuisine preference
- **Example:** Same photo of a curry dish:
  - Thai user → AI identifies it as "Red Curry" (coconut milk, Thai basil, Red curry paste)
  - Indian user → AI identifies it as "Butter Chicken" (ghee, turmeric, garam masala)
  - Japanese user → AI identifies it as "Japanese Curry Rice" (roux, potato, carrot)
- **Why this matters:** Visually similar dishes from different cuisines have drastically different ingredients and calorie profiles
- **No other app does this** — a true competitive moat

### 1.5 Gallery Auto-Scan — "Live First, Log Later"
- Pull down to refresh on the Timeline → MiRO scans your phone's photo gallery for food photos
- Found photos are saved as **0 kcal placeholder entries** with the image attached
- User taps any placeholder whenever they're ready → AI analyzes it with full ingredient breakdown
- **Why this is revolutionary:** You don't need to stop eating to open an app. Just take photos like you normally do. Later — on the train, on the couch, whenever — pull to refresh and let MiRO find them all. Analyze at your own pace.
- **No other app does this.** Every other food tracker requires you to log IN THE MOMENT or lose the data.

### 1.6 Meal Journey — Tell AI Your Entire Day at Once
- In the AI Chat, describe your whole day's meals in a single message:
  - *"This morning I had 3 pancakes with maple syrup, for lunch I had pad thai with shrimp, afternoon I drank an iced latte, and for dinner I had grilled salmon with rice and miso soup"*
- AI parses everything → splits by meal type (Breakfast / Lunch / Snack / Dinner) → analyzes each item with full ingredient breakdown → logs them ALL at once
- Every entry includes sub-ingredients down to the raw components
- Don't like something? Edit any entry afterward — remove an ingredient, adjust portions, change meal type
- **Why this matters:** Other apps make you log one meal at a time, one item at a time. MiRO lets you brain-dump your entire day in 30 seconds and walks away with a complete nutrition journal.

### 1.7 Self-Growing Personal Food Database
- Every food you log (whether from AI or manual entry) is saved to your **personal local database**
- The more you use MiRO, the smarter it gets FOR YOU
- Your "My Meals" and "Ingredients" library grows organically with your eating patterns
- After a few weeks, most of your daily meals can be logged with **one tap** from your personal database — no AI needed, no Energy spent
- This means **the app becomes MORE useful and MORE free over time**

### 1.8 Dual AI System (Free + Premium)
- **Local AI** — Free, unlimited, works offline. Type a food name and get nutrition instantly from your growing local database
- **MiRO AI** — Powered by Google Gemini. Analyzes photos, understands natural language, highest accuracy. Uses Energy Tokens
- **1 Free AI analysis per day** — active streak users get daily free AI access, no Energy needed

### 1.9 You OWN Your Data and Your Purchases — Anti-Subscription Philosophy
- **No account required** — No login, no sign-up, no email, no phone number. Ever.
- **All data stored locally** — Your health data stays on YOUR device. We can't see it even if we wanted to
- **Energy Tokens never expire** — You buy them, you own them. Unlike monthly subscriptions that vanish when you stop paying
- **Subscription is optional, not forced** — Energy Pass exists for power users, but you can use MiRO fully without it:
  - Manual logging is always free
  - Local AI database lookups are always free
  - 1 free AI analysis per day (with streak)
  - One-time Energy purchases available (pay-per-use)
- **This is the anti-"own nothing" app** — In an era where every app demands monthly fees, MiRO lets you pay once and keep it forever. Or don't pay at all and still get genuine value

### Target Audience:
- **Primary:** Health-conscious individuals who want effortless food logging
- **Secondary:** People actively losing weight / counting calories
- **Tertiary:** Gym & fitness enthusiasts tracking macros
- **Pain Point Audiences:**
  - Frustrated with calorie counter apps that require manual data entry
  - Frustrated with apps that don't recognize non-Western food
  - Frustrated with mandatory subscriptions — "I just want to track food, not rent software"
  - Privacy-conscious users who don't want to create accounts or share health data
- **Geographic Focus:** Southeast Asia first, then global (especially markets underserved by Western-centric apps: India, Middle East, Latin America, East Asia)

### Brand Positioning:
> MiRO is the most accurate AI food tracker ever built. While other apps give you a single calorie number and call it a day, MiRO deconstructs every dish into individual ingredients — including the hidden oil, the sugar in sauces, and the seasonings you can't see. And if the AI gets something wrong? Edit it yourself. Remove what you didn't eat. Adjust what you actually had. No other app gives you this level of control.
>
> MiRO is also the first AI food tracker that truly understands global cuisines. While other apps force you to search a Western-centric database, MiRO's AI sees your food through YOUR cultural lens — identifying dishes, ingredients, and hidden calories with the precision of a food scientist who grew up eating what you eat.
>
> And unlike every other app in this space: no account required, no login, no monthly subscription trap. You buy Energy, you own it forever. Your data stays on your device. Period.

## 15. WHY MiRO IS THE MOST ACCURATE FOOD TRACKER

Most food tracking apps give you ONE number: "Fried Rice — 500 calories." That's it. Take it or leave it.

MiRO's accuracy comes from **5 layers of precision stacked together**, which no competitor offers:

| Layer | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. AI Ingredient Decomposition** | Breaks every dish into individual ingredients with separate calories | You see exactly WHERE the calories come from |
| **2. Sub-Ingredient Breakdown** | Each ingredient further breaks down into components (meat + batter + oil) | Captures hidden calories in cooking methods |
| **3. Search Mode Selection** | User tells AI: "This is cooked food" or "This is a packaged product" | AI uses the right analysis strategy from the start |
| **4. Cuisine Preference Bias** | AI knows the user typically eats Thai/Indian/Japanese/etc. | Ambiguous dishes get identified correctly based on cultural context |
| **5. User Editing** | Remove, add, or adjust any ingredient after AI analysis | Human correction on top of AI analysis = maximum accuracy |
| **6. Gallery Catch-All** | Auto-finds food photos you took throughout the day | Nothing gets forgotten — every meal photo becomes a log entry |
| **7. Meal Journey Batch** | Describe your entire day → AI splits and analyzes each meal separately | Complete daily nutrition even if you forgot to log in the moment |

**The result:** AI analysis + cultural context + user correction = accuracy that no single AI model can achieve alone.

**Example — Instant Noodles:**
- Other apps: "Instant Noodles — 380 kcal" (that's it)
- MiRO: Noodle Block (350 kcal) + Seasoning Powder (45 kcal) + Oil Packet (90 kcal) + Dried Vegetables (5 kcal)
- User skipped the oil packet → removes it → final count: 400 kcal (not 490 kcal)
- **Difference: 90 calories.** Multiply by 365 days = 32,850 calories/year = ~4.2 kg of body weight.
